# Python Console Tasks Unit 1

---

## Task 1: Introduction to Python & Installation

**Objective**: Verify Python installation and write a simple program.

- Write a Python program that prints "Hello, Python World!" to the console.
- Save the program as `hello.py` and run it using the command line.

---

## Task 2: Variables and Data Types

**Objective**: Practice declaring variables with different data types.

- Create variables to store:
  - Your name (string)
  - Your age (integer)
  - Your height in meters (float)
  - Whether you are a student (boolean)
- Print all variables with descriptive messages, e.g., "My name is \[name\]."

---

## Task 3: Input/Output Operations

**Objective**: Use input() and print() for user interaction.

- Write a program that:
  - Prompts the user to enter their favorite color.
  - Stores the input in a variable.
  - Prints a message like "Your favorite color is \[color\]!"

---

## Task 4: Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical)

**Objective**: Use operators to perform calculations and comparisons.

- Write a program that:
  - Takes two numbers as input from the user.
  - Calculates their sum, difference, product, and division.
  - Checks if the first number is greater than the second and if both are positive.
  - Prints all results with clear labels.

---

## Task 5: Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

**Objective**: Implement decision-making with conditional statements.

- Write a program that:
  - Asks the user to enter a number.
  - Checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
  - Prints an appropriate message, e.g., "The number is positive."

---

## Task 6: Loops (for, while)

**Objective**: Use loops to repeat tasks.

- Write a program that:
  - Uses a `for` loop to print all even numbers from 1 to 20.
  - Uses a `while` loop to print a countdown from 10 to 1, followed by "Blast off!"

---

## Task 7: Functions and Parameters

**Objective**: Create and call functions with parameters.

- Write a function called `calculate_area` that:
  - Takes length and width as parameters.
  - Returns the area of a rectangle (length \* width).
- Call the function with sample values and print the result.

---

## Task 8: Lambda Functions

**Objective**: Use lambda functions for simple operations.

- Create a lambda function that takes two numbers and returns their product.
- Use the lambda function to calculate the product of 5 and 6, and print the result.

---

## Task 9: Exception Handling

**Objective**: Handle errors gracefully using try-except.

- Write a program that:
  - Asks the user to enter two numbers and divides the first by the second.
  - Uses try-except to handle division by zero.
  - Prints the result or an error message like "Cannot divide by zero!"

---

## Task 10: Working with Modules & Packages

**Objective**: Import and use a module.

- Write a program that:
  - Imports the `math` module.
  - Uses `math.sqrt()` to calculate the square root of a user-input number.
  - Prints the result rounded to 2 decimal places.

---

## Task 11: File Handling (read/write .txt, .csv)

**Objective**: Read from and write to files.

- Write a program that:
  - Creates a text file named `notes.txt` and writes a short message to it.
  - Reads the content of `notes.txt` and prints it.
- Bonus: Create a CSV file named `students.csv` with columns "Name" and "Grade". Write two sample rows and read the file to print its contents.

---

**Instructions for Students**:

- Save each task as a separate file (e.g., `task1`.ipynb, `task2`.ipynb, etc.).
- Test your programs in a Python environment .
- Ensure your code includes comments explaining the purpose of each section.
